# ad-sources

## Problem Statement:

Task is to develop a SelectSourcePage as per the [design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqTierO6Pgvbpn_UkS5Ry9vIXXmy3W-H/view). As you click the "TEST / DEBUG" button, the page should list all the data sources that you get fetch from an API.

### CodeSandbox: https://vh0m0.csb.app/

### Approach:

- (OLD) On every single click to add favorite source, I am changing the location of that particular object in the array and adding it at the top which implements the feature of moving element at the top on favorite.

- (NEW) On receving the data from the API, I am adding few fields to the received data, which makes to easier to implement the required functionalities.  

### Known Issues:

- Let's say we have 3 favorite sources and all of them are at the top, now if we unmark the middle source it doesn't update the list and move the 3rd favorite at the top. (âœ… Fixed)
